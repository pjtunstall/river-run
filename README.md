## Overview

This website was made for an application process. The brief: to create a website that would introduce yourself, say why you want a career in web development, and showcase some of your projects. I thought it would be a nice opportunity to explore web components.

## Credits

I used the fantasy map-making tool [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/) to draw the river.
