## Overview

This website was made as part of an application process. The brief was simple: to create a website that would introduce yourself, say why you want a career in web development, and showcase some of your projects. I thought it would be a nice opportunity to explore web components.

## Credits

The map background images were made with [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/), an online tool that lets you put together maps in a variety of vantasy styles.
