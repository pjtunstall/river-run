# River Run

## Overview

This website was made as part of an application to join a course, that unfortunately was canceled. The brief: to create a website--using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript--that would introduce yourself, say why you want a career in web development, and showcase some of your projects. I thought it would be a nice opportunity to explore web components.

The markers on the map represent stages in a web browser's [event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Execution_model).

## Credits

I used the fantasy map-making tool [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/) to draw the river.
