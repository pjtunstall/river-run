    It's been a zigzag path to coding. I've sailed schooners on the Great Lakes
    and tended sheep in snowy Cumbria. I've studied maths and Old Norse. I wrote
    a book. Is there a pattern here?

    In 2022, I joined 01Founders, a peer-led, project-based bootcamp-style
    course. It quickly became my absolute consuming passion. I now have three
    years' experience of Go, two and a half of JavaScript, and one of Rust.

    I've built what I hope is a solid foundation in software development through
    complex solo and group projects. The course is highly collaborative. I've
    revelled in the camaraderie.

    I'm drawn to coding because I can't resist a good puzzle. I love how there's
    always more to learn, whichever way you look, however deep you go. Web
    development is especially fun because you get to affect a user's experience
    directly, and the results are accessible to anyone with an internet
    connnection.

    I'm now seeking my first professional role as a developer. I feel very ready
    for the next challenge. I can offer curiosity, reliability, and a strong
    work ethic. I'm looking for a supportive team, some mentorship, and a chance
    to show what I can do.
  </p>
  <p>Don't let the whimsy fool you. I'm quite set on this.</p>
